## Problem Statement

We want to create an application for hospital management. It should have the follow features :-

1. Patient comes for treatment. Patient has to give his name , phone number and what issues he has.
2. Patient can have multiple issue. So like a patient can have fever , cough . Problem description , HowManday , Value
3. Patient is allocated to doctor who gives him treatments.Only 1 patient allocated to a doctor.
4. For every problem there will be medication / treatment. For one problem there are can be mutliple treatment and medication.
5. A medication / treatment will have name , description( 3 times in day)
6. Hospital have staffs which are Nurses , doctors  and  ward boys.

## HMS
Currently HMS has code that showcases :-
- [x] Private
- [x] Public
- [x] Protected
- [x] Internal
- [x] Inheritance of a class.

## BoxUnbox
* Boxing[Stack -> Heap] and Unboxing[Heap -> Stack] are computationally expensive processes. When a value type is boxed, a new object must be allocated and constructed. To a lesser degree, the cast required for unboxing is also expensive computationally. 
* Use **Generics** to avoid this performance issue altogether!

## Delegates
* Here I showed declaration, instantiation, and use of a delegate that can be used to reference method[Adding Number here] that take an integer parameter and returns an integer value.
